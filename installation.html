            <p class="blog-post-meta">April 29th, 2018 by <a href="index.html">Ian</a></p>

            <p>I plan to change the directory of this project from installation to neThing, to be in line with the project. This change is planned to take place on or after May 7th.</p>
            <p>The reason for the name change is that I originally intended for this project to be a sound art installation, but instead, it has become a research project in creating educational interfaces for ambisonic systems. Big difference! </p>

            <p>I got word this morning from the ICMC proposal committee that my paper was accepted for an oral presentation! This means that I get to go to Daegu, Korea from the 5th to the 10th of August this summer! Now, I have to revamp my paper by conducting more research and finishing the software! This is very exciting for me as they will also be publishing the paper at the end of the conference!</p>

            <p>Going forward, I plan to conduct a study on people who have used the old interfaces and compare them to the one I created. I also plan to conduct a survey to see what features I should add into the interface. As of right now, some new features I would like to add would be the ability to have multiple sound sources, multiple nodes, and sample drag in and play. </p>

            <p class="blog-post-meta">April 22nd, 2018 by <a href="index.html">Ian</a></p>

            <p>Finally got the project up and running! Right now, It runs on localhost, but that is only because I am running it for testing. If a user wanted to create a version for their own use, it would be pretty simple to download the repo and run it via <code>node Server.js</code>.</p>
            <p> Here is what the current version looks like right now: </p>
            <p><img src="images\interface_JS_42218.png" class="img-thumbnail rounded"alt="Responsive image"/img></p>
            <p>You can see the room view, with a black square node signifying the sound in space(xy). The side panel is a dynamic "add function" view, that allows a user to add new objects that connect to OSC output automatically. On the bottom is server specific toggles that the person setting up the server for users to access can define. For this purpose, I went with some wavetable options, but these are really all up to the user. </p>

            <p>I realized that for my purposes, OSC will not work with ruby as the packages avaliable are outdated and will not run. I did some research into the easiest fix and it turns out I will need to switch the entire project over to a Node.js server. I do not know node, but I will have to learn if I want this to work, so its time to drink a lot of coffee!</p>

            <p>I am back from Iceland, with tons of fresh new ideas for crating music and finishing coding projects! I found out from the UGRS that my abstract was accepted, so I will give a oral presentation on my research this April 25th! Hopefully the website works by then...</p>
            <p>I also have nearly finished the ruby code for creating and running the server. For the front end, I am using javascript and bootstrap, using a minimal design. I plan to start sending OSC signals over UDP to any audio engine listening on the port that the server is sending on. </p>

            <p class="blog-post-meta">February 13th, 2018 by <a href="index.html">Ian</a></p>

            <p>I decided that this project would be better suited as a web interface to aid in the education of ambisonic and wave field systems. I began creating the webapp using ruby on rails. As of right now, I am unsure how I plan to connect the website to the audio engine, but I plan to make it dynamic and very hackable so that whoever decides to run the server for their system, they can tune it to their own special settings.</p>
            <p>I will begin research on different already existing interfaces and see if there is a piece of software like this that currently exists for educational purposes. This research will be compiled into a paper with statistics of whether it actually aids in education or not. </p>
            <p>The project and subsequent software will fall under the catergory "neThing", as I intend to create this software server package to be open source and hackable to work on any ambisonic or wavefield array and on any web browser for any device.<p>

            <h2 class="blog-post-title">Interactive Sound Installation</h2>
            <p class="blog-post-meta">February 1st, 2018 by <a href="index.html">Ian</a></p>

            <p>I began work conceptualizing a semester long multichannel project. Currently the plan is to create ambisonic recordings and learn the basics of multichannel music and sound production. I plan to then incorporate this new material in some sort of interactive sound installation that lets users modify, learn, and play with the sounds and virtual space they hear in the room.</p>
            <p>In order to complete this task, I will create a webapp for people to access the ambisonic array in the room they are currently in via a wireless connection to a server.
              Whoever sets up the array will also set up the server and be able to specify the location of each speaker among other ambisonic requirements for room space and acoustics.
              A user of the webapp will be able to access the page on their mobile device or tablet/laptop computer, as well as any other device that can connect to the internet and access the web page where the app is being hosted with the correct software implementations - i.e., Internet Explorer and Java or Google Chrome and Adobe Flash.
            </p>
            <p>Next, since I would like this program to be more of an educational tool than anything, I plan to let users be able to experiment with the sounds and waveforms without necessarily needing to be connected to the server, so I will have an option to output audio directly from their device.
              It will be interesting to see in large groups of people, the methods used for sound grouping socially and the effects of sounds populated in large clusters and so forth. </p>
            <p>Here are some conceptualization sketches I made today for the user interface. I plan to use bootstrap for dynamic webpages, and JavaScript for designing interfaces. As of right now, the idea for the sounds is night creatures, specifically bugs like crickets and katydids.</p>
            <p><img src="images\wave_concept_1.jpg" class="img-thumbnail rounded"alt="Responsive image"/img><img src="images\wave_concept_3.jpg" class="img-thumbnail rounded"alt="Responsive image"/img><img src="images\wave_concept_2.jpg" class="img-thumbnail rounded"alt="Responsive image"/img></p>
            <p>I am hoping to get the webapp finished for testing within a month. I plan to use Ruby on Rails as of right now, but that might change, as I am currently learning node.js. We will see.</p>
            <p>You can follow along with my personal endeavor of creating a portable wave field synthesis array <a href="wavefield.html">here</a>, and see the conceptualization of my ambisonic improvisational music collection <a href="ambisonic.html">here!</a></p>
