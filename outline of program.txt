maybe not vst but rather standalond program

output song with song pattern choices based on input file
	user parameters:
		tempo?
		key?
		energy
		random
		authechre
	build in algorithms:
		match patterns to bank of song layouts
		match melodys to bank of melodys
outputs 2 folders? maybe just one, maybe optional to ouput these folders
	midi loops
		melodys
	samples that are named
		lead sounds
		bass sounds
		drum sound
		perc sounds


classes
	sample

functions for creating sound
	granulator and repitcher for leads/basses
		bank of algorithims to choose from
			808s
			low tones to be looped or pitched/shifted
			high tones for melodies/pads
			mid tones for vocalsynth sounds/pads?
			rumble
			growl
			sakuraburst style sounds
	pattern matcher for drums also fills
		kick
		tom
		snare
		clap
		crash
	pattern matcher for percs
		hi hat
		ripshot
		plink
		pop
		random cool sounds

all sounds can be used for leads using granulator
granulator can make noise in background for ambiance

effects i would want to have
	repitch
	repitch and delay
	delay ping pong and spacializer
	reverb
	granulator and reverb
	panning
	volume
	distortion?
	eq
	overdrive
make kicks by:
	finding suitable sample, shape it/cut it out
	finding non suitable sample and repitch so it is in the 30hz range, eq, saturate, eq shape, compress, overdrive?, i think thats all



algorrithms for making sounds
	repeat certian pattern for size of sample/ time
	exponential sizes
	logarithmic sizes
	fibonacci sequences
	randomized length and time
	growing bacteria
	take algortihms from nature
