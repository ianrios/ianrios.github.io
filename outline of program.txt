standalone program

output song with song pattern choices based on input file
	user parameters:
		tempo?
		key?
		energy
		random
		authechre style ya know
	build in algorithms:
		match patterns to bank of song layouts for structure
		create melodys and chords from list of song keys to choose from
classes
	sample banks
	chord element
	song sructure element?

functions for creating sound
	granulator and repitcher for leads/basses
		bank of algorithims to choose from and create:
			808s
			low tones to be looped or pitched/shifted
			high tones for melodies/pads
			mid tones for vocalsynth sounds/pads?
			rumble
			growl
			sakuraburst style sounds
	pattern matcher for drums also fills to make:
		kick
		tom
		snare
		clap
		crash
	pattern matcher for percs to make:
		hi hat
		ripshot
		plink
		pop
		random cool sounds

all sounds can be used for leads using granulator
granulator can make noise in background for ambiance

effects i would want to have
	repitch
	repitch and delay
	delay ping pong and spacializer
	reverb
	granulator and reverb
	panning
	volume
	distortion?
	eq
	overdrive
	saturator
	compressor
	limiter
make kicks by:
	finding suitable sample, shape it/cut it out
	finding non suitable sample and repitch so it is in the 30hz range, eq, saturate, eq shape, compress, overdrive, limit?, i think thats all
make leads by random parameters in granulator, repitcher, and by adding random effects that sound good

algorithms for making sounds
	repeat certian pattern for size of sample/ time
	exponential sizes
	logarithmic sizes
	fibonacci sequences
	randomized length and time
	growing bacteria
	take algortihms from nature
	phi
	no algorithms that sound like trash, test them first
